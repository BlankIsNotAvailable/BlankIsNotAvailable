            <h2>About us</h2>
            <p>We are a team of a cook and a coder that made this website possible. Many hours of work were sinked into this project by the head-chef and recipy creator Robin Bachenheimer. Sean Zgraggen is the head of the IT department, which only consists of himself. This Website was specially prepared fresh from scratch, just like all of the Recipes, for Robins cooking. </p>
